Main Goal
=========
Backup & restore EC2 instances

Description
==========
Excercised my backup & disastery recovery skills by creating an EC2 instance(server-demo)
containing a file(personal-message.txt). Once up and running, I created an AMI image from
server-demo and used it to create another EC2 instance(server2-demo). Validation was completed
successfully by confirming the identical personal-message file was located on server2-demo.
